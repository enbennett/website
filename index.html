                <p>
                And welcome to my webpage. My name is Emma Bennett. I hope you enjoy the site. This is a personal project of mine to improve my coding. If you follow the menu above you can navigate to see my finished projects under Portfolio. If you're a friend (or just have feedback) feel free to leave me a note on the Friends tab (feature coming soon)!

                A little more detail about me, I got my bachelor's in chemical engineering at Mizzou (go tigers!) in 2019 and from there I worked in consulting as an industrial water process engineer for four years. I have always been interested in coding and in January of 2023 I decided the time was finally right to pursue it. I will be attending Mizzou this fall as a master's of computer science student!
